      For once Benjamin consented to break his rule, and he read out to her
      what was written on the wall. There was nothing there now except a
      single Commandment. It ran:
    </p>
    <strong>
      ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL
      BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL
      THAN OTHERS
    </strong>
    <p>
    After that it did not seem strange when next day the pigs who were
    supervising the work of the farm all carried whips in their trotters. It did
    not seem strange to learn that the pigs had bought themselves a wireless
    set, were arranging to install a telephone, and had taken out
    subscriptions to John Bull, TitBits, and the Daily Mirror. It did not
    seem strange when Napoleon was seen strolling in the farmhouse
    garden with a pipe in his mouth-no, not even when the pigs took Mr.
    Jones's clothes out of the wardrobes and put them on, Napoleon himself
    appearing in a black coat, ratcatcher breeches, and leather leggings,
    while his favourite sow appeared in the watered silk dress which Mrs.
    Jones had been used to wear on Sundays.
